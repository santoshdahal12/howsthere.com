This website just has 2 pages. I created this blog using gastby-cli when I had a month time and I was leaving Mobile and Micro-front-end team to Data platform team. I thought I will still do some front-end work even when I focus in tools and cloud infrastructure.
This website has SEO  and also a disqus hooked up. I build it in a way that I would have to only write only markdown file. However, lot of things have chnaged in 3 years.

1. My local Node in Mac is v20.6.1. Before it was possibly 8
2. React now is 18.x.x. Before it was 16.x.x
3. Gatsby itself have evolved.My first attempt was, lets just use npm ci. It failed indicating that my node is very new and got lot of errors.
